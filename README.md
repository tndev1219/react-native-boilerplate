### Motivation: 
While creating this project, I always need to a react-native standart for our team. When we start to new project, we always spend too much time. So that, we created `react-native-boilerplate` and we wanted to share with the community.

## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>
<!-- 
  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd> -->

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard i18n internationalization support</dt>
  <dd>Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.</dd>

  <dt>Static code analysis</dt>
  <dd>Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.</dd>

</dl>

But wait... there's more!

- _The best test setup:_ Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
  changes. (Seen a react-native app with 100% test coverage before?)
- _The fastest fonts:_ Say goodbye to vacant text.
- _Stay fast_: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
  line!
<!-- - _Catch problems:_ AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
  tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix. -->

<!-- There’s also a <a href="https://vimeo.com/168648012">fantastic video</a> on how to structure your React.js apps with scalability in mind. It provides rationale for the majority of boilerplate's design decisions. -->

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/keremcubuk/react-native-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Run `react-native-rename <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` before `npm install`.
5.  Android and iOS runnning is different. So that follow the steps below.
    - For iOS `cd ios` and run `pod install`. Go to directory '`cd ..`' and run `react-native run-ios`
    - For Android `react-native run-android`.
6.  Finally, you are ready to start development.
<!-- 4.  Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._ -->
<!-- 5.  Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app. -->

Now you're ready to rumble!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.
